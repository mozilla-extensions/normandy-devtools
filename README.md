## Installation

Since Normandy Devtools is an exceptionally niche add-on, it is not hosted on
AMO. You can install it from [the releases page on
Github](https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/normandy-devtools/releases).
Expand the assets section of the release you want to install, and click on
the `.xpi` file. Firefox will prompt you to install the extension. From
there, you can access Normandy devtools using the new wrench icon in the top
right of the browser window.

Happy debugging!
